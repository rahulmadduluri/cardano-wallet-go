# cardano-wallet-go
Extremely simplistic Golang implementation of a Cadano Wallet API
Using Basic Model specifications from https://cardanodocs.com/files/formal-specification-of-the-cardano-wallet.pdf
Just making this for fun / learning exercise. Not intended to be used as a legitimate wallet.

IOHK's Wallet API is located at: input-output-hk/cardano-sl
